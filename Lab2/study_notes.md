<ins>ml in struture_based discovery</ins>

why need bound structures
- predict affinity
- understand key amino acids n the interaction - contact residues
- screen or design better binders

used in
- virtual screening
- hit discovery
- lead optimization
- reverse screening

ligand pose described by:
- local structures -> bond lengths, bond angles, chirality, ring structures
- position
- orientation
- torsion angles
